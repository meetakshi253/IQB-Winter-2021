Changing the gap penalty affects the arithmetic of the whole DP table resulting in different answers. Coincidentaly, the same optimal sequence alignments that totalled to 9 in Question 1, scored 7 here too. This happened because globally aligning the two given sequences would anyway require at least two gaps in the second sequence.\n",

It can also be seen that the maximum alignment score i.e. 8 occurs in multiple positions in the new dp2 matrix compared to 10 appearing only once in the old matrix dp2. This will give us locally aligned sequences of varied lengths. When penalty on gaps is increased, local alignment avoids adding too much of them. Consequently, it is seen that 5 different possible optimum locally aligned sequences of various lengths are generated compared to the 3 in Question 2. All these newly generated sequences score 8 according to the new  scoring criteria."
